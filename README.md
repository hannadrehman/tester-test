# tester-test

## implement folowing functionality from jest

describe
it
expect
toBe
toBeTruthy
not


example
```
decribe('define what test does in this string', ()=>{

     it('define what exactly you are testing',()=>{

     })
})
```
All tests should pass with local test runner.
all failing tests should also fail with local test runner

jest adds alot of cosmetics to the tests, we can ignore it.
we should be able to see what tests passed, and what failed.
if we can tell why a test failed. its a bonus point
we are only testing primitive data types. number,string,booleans.
it should work on other examples too which are not mentioned in the spec files.
